The one-minute guide to using ClusterONE
========================================

ClusterONE is distributed in a Java archive file (JAR), which contains both
the command line application and the Cytoscape application. In this document, we
are assuming that you want to use ClusterONE from the Cytoscape graphical
user interface. If you are interested in the command line interface, please
refer to the documentation distributed with the command line interface itself.

ClusterONE can be installed from the Cytoscape app manager. Launch
Cytoscape if you have not done so, click on the **App Manager** item of the
**Apps** menu, enter **ClusterONE** into the **Search** text box, select the
ClusterONE app from the list in the middle, and click on the **Install** button.
Cytoscape should download and install the selected version of ClusterONE for
you. If you see more than one version of Cluster ONE, make sure you install the
most recent one. If you don't see any Cluster ONE version, first check whether
you have installed it already (look for a menu called **ClusterONE** within the
**Apps** submenu).

If you managed to install ClusterONE successfully, you should see a new menu
item called **ClusterONE** in the **Apps** submenu. Now, do the following:

- Load the network you wish to analyse into Cytoscape.
   
- Click on **Apps/ClusterONE/Start** to start ClusterONE. This will add
  a new panel called **ClusterONE** to the control panels on the left.

- If your network is weighted, select the name of the weight attribute on the
  ClusterONE control panel next to **Edge weights**. If you do not see the
  desired attribute name, click on the **Refresh** button (|refresh|) next to
  the combo box.  If you still do not see it, make sure that the attribute is
  registered in Cytoscape as a numeric attribute and not a string.

- Click on the **Start** button at the bottom of the panel. ClusterONE should
  detect the densely connected regions of your network and list them in a
  new panel on the Cytoscape result panel, which is usually on the right hand
  side of the window.

- Clicking on a cluster in the result panel will highlight the cluster in the
  network view. Double-clicking on a cluster will extract it as a new
  subnetwork. Right-clicking on a cluster will bring up a context menu with
  additional operations that you might find useful.

- When you are finished with analysing the results, click on the **Close**
  button (|close|) in the upper right corner of the result panel.


Description of the algorithm

The ClusterONE menu
===================

ClusterONE installs itself into the Apps menu of Cytoscape under
a submenu named **ClusterONE**. This submenu has the following items:

**Start**
    Shows the `control panel`_ of ClusterONE, which is the main entry
    point to the clustering algorithm implemented in ClusterONE.

**Grow cluster from selected nodes**
    Grows a single cluster according to the steps of the ClusterONE algorithm,
    starting from the selected nodes which will be treated as a single seed set.
    For more details about the growth process, please refer to the
    `description of the algorithm`. The resulting cluster will be selected
    after the growth process is finished.

    This menu item remains disabled until you start the ClusterONE app
    using the corresponding menu item.

**Color nodes by affinity**
    Colors the nodes of the network according to their affinity to the
    currently selected set of nodes as a cluster. Nodes with a positive
    affinity to the cluster will be colored red, negative affinities will
    be shown using shades of blue. The affinity of a node tells us how much
    would the addition of that node increase the quality of the cluster.
    You can use this menu item to drive the cluster growth process manually
    by starting from a small seed cluster and repeatedly adding nodes to
    the cluster that increase the quality function the most. Note that
    you will have to recalculate the affinities every time you modify the
    cluster, ClusterONE won't do that automatically.

    Node coloring is implemented using a custom VizMapper style. This style
    is selected automatically when you click on this menu item, but you can
    always return to your original style in the VizMapper panel of Cytoscape.

    This menu item remains disabled until you start the ClusterONE app
    using the corresponding menu item.

**Help**
    Shows the manual of ClusterONE (this document) in a separate window.

**About**
    Shows the authors, the preferred citation for ClusterONE
    (see also `References`_) and the URL of its homepage.


Control panel
=============

The control panel of ClusterONE is to be found on a separate tab in the
control panel of Cytoscape (see the left hand side of the Cytoscape user
interface). The panel consists of two large parts: the `Parameters`_ box lets
you set the parameters of the algorithm (this is subdivided into `Basic
parameters`_ and `Advanced parameters`_), while the `Selection info`_ box lets
you examine some properties of the currently selected set of nodes (such as the
total weight of edges within the set and at the boundary of the set, or the
value of the ClusterONE quality function).

Click on the **Start** button at the bottom of the panel to start the clustering
process. The `result viewer`_ will open automatically when the results are ready.
Use the **Close panel** button to hide the ClusterONE control panel.

After a successful clustering process, the nodes of the network will be colored
according to the number of clusters they participate in. Nodes that correspond
to a single cluster only will turn red, nodes with multiple clusters will turn
yellow. Gray nodes denote outliers (nodes that did not end up in any of the
clusters).  This coloring is implemented using a custom VizMapper style. The
style is selected automatically when the clustering process finishes, but you
can always return to your original style in the VizMapper panel of Cytoscape.


Parameters
----------

The parameters are grouped into basic and advanced ones. In most of the cases,
the default values of the advanced parameters should be fine, but the basic
parameters may need to be adjusted to your specific needs.

Basic parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Minimum size**
    The minimum size of clusters deemed relevant by ClusterONE.
    This is a hard threshold: whenever ClusterONE finds a cluster
    smaller than the minimum size, the cluster will be discarded
    immediately.

**Minimum density**
    The minimum density of clusters deemed relevant by ClusterONE.
    The density of a cluster is the total sum of edge weights within
    the cluster, divided by the number of theoretically possible
    edges within the cluster. In other words, this is the average edge
    weight within the cluster if missing edges are assumed to have a
    weight of zero. Whenever ClusterONE finds a cluster that has a
    smaller density than the value given here, the cluster will be
    discarded immediately. Increase the minimum density if you get
    too many clusters and they seem too sparse, or decrease it if you
    are not getting enough clusters.

    Since version 0.93, ClusterONE also includes an automatic density
    threshold selection method, which was tuned on various protein-protein
    interaction datasets. When the "Auto" value is selected in the minimum
    density field (this can be selected by trying to choose a density
    threshold smaller than zero), ClusterONE will use a density threshold
    of 0.3 for weighted networks and 0.5 for unweighted networks. If the
    network is unweighted and the global clustering coefficient is smaller
    than 0.1, ClusterONE will assume that the network was determined from
    low-throughput experimental data (e.g., yeast-two-hybrid experiments)
    and use a higher threshold of 0.6 to compensate for the presence of
    many tree-like subgraphs in the input.

**Edge weights**
    A numeric edge attribute to be used for the edge weights. *[unweighted]*
    means that each edge will have a weight equal to 1. If you don't see the
    name of the attribute in the list, click on the **Refresh** button
    (|refresh|) next to the combo box to re-scan the network for numeric edge
    attributes. This is necessary when you added the edge attribute you are
    looking for after you opened the ClusterONE control panel.

Advanced parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not see these parameters in the `control panel`_, click on the
**Advanced parameters** label to expand the container holding them.

**Node penalty**
    Penalty value corresponding to each node. When you set this option to
    a specific value *x*, ClusterONE will assume that each node has an
    extra boundary weight of *x* when it considers the addition of the node
    to a cluster (see [1]_ for more details). It can be used to model the
    possibility of uncharted connections for each node, so nodes with only
    a single weak connection to a cluster will not be added to the cluster as
    the penalty value will outweigh the benefits of adding the node. The
    default penalty value is 2.

**Merging method**, **Overlap threshold** and **Similarity function**
    After an initial set of clusters are found, ClusterONE tries to
    merge highly overlapping (and thus redundant) clusters in order to
    clean up the result. For each pair of clusters found, ClusterONE
    calculates a score that quantifies the overlap between them, and
    two clusters are merged if this overlap is larger than a given
    threshold (specified by the **Overlap threshold** textbox). There
    are four different ways to calculate the overlap score, as controlled
    by the **Similarity function** combobox:

        - The *match coefficient* takes the size of the overlap squared,
          divided by the product of the sizes of the two clusters being
          considered, as in the paper of Bader and Hogue [2]_.

        - The *Simpson coefficient* divides the size of the overlap
          by the size of the smaller cluster.

        - The *Jaccard similarity* divides the size of the overlap by the
          size of the union of the two clusters.

        - The *Dice similarity* divides twice the size of the overlap by
          the sum of the sizes of the two clusters.
          
    Merging can be done in two different ways, as controlled by the
    **Merging method** combobox:
    
        - The *single-pass method* calculates similarity scores between all pairs
          of complexes and creates a graph where the nodes are the
          complexes and two nodes are connected if the corresponding
          complexes have a score higher than the overlap threshold.
          Complexes in the same connected component of the graph will then
          be merged.
                        
        - The *multi-pass method* calculates similarity scores between all pairs
          of complexes and stores those pairs that have a score
          larger than the overlap threshold. The highest scoring pair
          is then merged and the similarity of the merged complex
          towards its neighbors is re-calculated. This is repeated
          until there are no more highly overlapping complexes in
          the result.
    
    The default settings (match coefficient with a threshold of 0.8 using
    the single-pass algorithm) seem to be satisfactory for most use-cases
    Decreasing the threshold will result in more clusters being merged.

**Seeding method**
    ClusterONE works by growing clusters from initial "seeds", driven
    by a goal function that is maximized greedily (see the Cluster
    ONE paper [1]_ for more details). A seed can be an arbitrary subgraph,
    but in most cases, it is either a single node or a single edge.
    The seeding method prescribes how the seeds are selected during the
    calculation:

        - *From every node* means that every node will be used as a seed.

        - *From unused nodes* means that nodes will be tried in the
          descending order of their weights (where the weight of a node is
          the sum of the weights on its incident edges), and whenever a
          cluster is found, the nodes in that cluster will be excluded from
          the list of potential seeds. In other words, the node with the
          largest weight that does *not* participate in any of the clusters
          found so far will be selected as the next seed.

        - *From every edge* means that every edge will be considered once,
          each yielding a seed consisting of the two endpoints of the edge.

    In practical use-cases, the *From unused nodes* and *From every node*
    methods are almost equivalent, but the former one yields a smaller
    number of redundant clusters.


Selection info
--------------

The quantities shown in this box always correspond to the currently selected
set of nodes in the current Cytoscape view.


**Number of nodes**
    The number of nodes in the cluster.

**In-weight**
    The sum of the weights of the edges that lie completely within the cluster.

**Out-weight**
    The sum of the weights of the edges where one endpoint lies within the cluster
    and the other lies outside.

**Density**
    The density of the cluster; that is, the sum of the edge weights within
    the cluster divided by the number of theoretically possible edges.

**Quality**
    The quality of the cluster, as measured by the in-weight divided by the
    sum of the in-weight and the out-weight. The rationale behind this measure
    is that a good cluster contains many heavyweight edges within the cluster
    itself, and it is connected to the rest of the network only by a few lightweight
    edges. If the penalty value set in the `Advanced parameters`_ panel is larger
    than zero, the out-weight of the cluster will be increased by the penalty
    value times the number of nodes in the cluster accordingly.

**P-value**
    The p-value of a one-sided Mann-Whitney U test performed on the in-weights
    and out-weights of the vertices. A low p-value means that the in-weights
    are significantly larger than the out-weights, so it is more likely that the
    cluster is a valid finding and not the result of random fluctuations.
    Color codes also help distinguishing significant results from insignificant
    ones: p-values less than 0.05 are denoted by red colors and p-values
    between 0.05 and 0.1 are shown in yellow.

Note that the Mann-Whitney U test cannot be performed sensibly when all the
in-weights and out-weights are equal. In this case, the p-value will show "NA".


Result viewer
=============

The result viewer appears on the right hand side of the Cytoscape user
interface after a successful clustering process and it can operate in two
modes: the `simple view`_ and the `detailed view`_. When the result viewer is
opened for the first time, the `simple view`_ is used, which shows each cluster
in a scrollable list box along with some basic properties of the cluster
(number of nodes, density, quality and p-value). The clusters are ordered
according to ascending p-values.  There is also a small `toolbar`_ above the list
of clusters, where the number of clusters are shown along with small push
buttons to access some of the functionality provided by the result viewer.

Simple view
-----------

The simple view uses two columns, the first column showing a schematic drawing of
each cluster (driven by a simple force-directed layout algorithm) and the second
showing some basic properties of the cluster. The clusters are drawn in the
background, so if there are many large clusters, you may have to wait a little bit
until you are able to see them all.

Right-clicking on any row of the table will bring up the `cluster context menu`_.
Double-clicking on any row will extract the cluster into a separate Cytoscape
network view.

Detailed view
-------------

The detailed view can be turned on or off by clicking on the first button of
the toolbar which shows a table (|details|). It is advised to turn the detailed
view on only if the result panel itself is detached from the main Cytoscape
window or if it is wide enough, as the detailed view contains seven columns,
the first showing a schematic drawing of the cluster itself, while the remaining
six correspond to the properties seen earlier in the `selection info`_ box
on the `control panel`_ (number of nodes, density, in-weight, out-weight,
quality and p-value).

In the detailed view, you can sort the clusters according to any of the above
columns by clicking on the column header. Clicking on the header again reverses
the order.

Right-clicking on any row of the table will bring up the `cluster context menu`_.
Double-clicking on any row will extract the cluster into a separate Cytoscape
network view.


Toolbar
-------

|details| **Switch to detailed view**
    This button toggles between the `simple view`_ and the `detailed view`_.

|find| **Find clusters of selected nodes**
    By clicking this button, ClusterONE will evaluate all the nodes that are
    selected in the current Cytoscape network and select the clusters in which
    at least one of the selected nodes participate. It can primarily be used
    to find the cluster(s) of a single node after selecting that node in the
    main Cytoscape panel.

|save| **Save clustering**
    Saves the clustering to disk in a file. You can choose from several
    clustering formats.

|close| **Close result**
    Closes the result set (i.e. removes its tab from the Results panel of
    Cytoscape).

.. |details| image:: images/details.png
.. |find|    image:: images/find.png
.. |save|    image:: images/save.png
.. |close|   image:: images/close.png


Cluster context menu
--------------------

This menu pops up whenever you right-click on a row in the results panel.
If there are multiple rows selected in the result set, the operations will
apply to all of them, otherwise they will apply to only the one you have
clicked on.

**Copy to clipboard**
    This menu item copies the IDs of the nodes in the selected clusters to
    the clipboard. If there are multiple clusters selected, one line
    in the copied text will correspond to one cluster. After copying,
    you can paste the IDs to a text editor or a word processor.

**Extract selected cluster(s)**
    Creates a new Cytoscape network from the subnetwork spanned by the
    nodes in the selected clusters. Even when multiple clusters are
    selected, only a single Cytoscape network will be created that includes
    all the nodes in all the selected clusters. This command can also
    be invoked for a single cluster by double-clicking on the cluster
    in the result list.

**Save selected cluster(s)**
    Saves the selected clusters into a text file in formats similar to
    the ones handled by the **Copy to clipboard** operation (either a
    plain text based format or the GenePro format).

**Remove**
    Removes the selected clusters from the result list.
